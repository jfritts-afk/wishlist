# My Christmas Wishlist

Welcome to my Christmas wishlist repository! ðŸŽ„âœ¨ Here, you'll find a list of items I'm interested in, including servers, old computers, and free hand-me-downs. Please note that this is just a fun way to share ideas, and I don't expect to receive everything on the list.

Feel free to explore the categories below and get a sense of what might make the perfect gift:
[Servers](/Wishlists/server_wishlist.md)
[Storage](/Wishlists/storage_wishlist.md)


**Note:** This repository is just for fun and sharing ideas. The actual gifts are entirely at your discretion, and I appreciate any thoughtful surprises! ðŸ˜Š
