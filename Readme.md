# My Christmas Wishlist

Welcome to my Christmas wishlist repository! ðŸŽ„âœ¨ Here, you'll find a list of items I'm interested in, including servers, old computers, and free hand-me-downs. Please note that this is just a fun way to share ideas, and I don't expect to receive everything on the list.

Feel free to explore the categories below and get a sense of what might make the perfect gift:
# [Servers](/Wishlists/server_wishlist.md)
# [Storage](/Wishlists/storage_wishlist.md)
# [Amazon](/Wishlists/amazon_lists.md)
>This is more so a list of different wish lists, not necessarily christmas specific. Some are projects that are not fully completed and need things, or projects that could be started, they will be labeled as such. This could be a good place for smaller gifts or ideas in general.



**Note:** This repository is just for fun and sharing ideas. The actual gifts are entirely at your discretion, and I appreciate any thoughtful surprises! ðŸ˜Š
